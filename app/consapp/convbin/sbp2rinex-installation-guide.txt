The sbp2rinex converter is a command line tool and is distributed in a compressed 
file for Windows, Linux and OSX computers.

The binary executable in the archive can be run and used immediately after decompressing.
For convenience, the steps below provide a possible installation method for your platform 
to make the converter available globally on the system.

  2. Create a tool directory if it doesn't exist yet, e.g. c:\tools\
  3. Copy sbp2rinex.exe file to the tools folder
  4. Add above folder name to the system Path variable to be able to call the converter 
     by the name only
     (Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> 
      System Variables -> Path variable)

       e.g. tar -xzvf sbp2rinex-1.0.tar.gz
