Important Notice

Swift Navigation has created a public RTKLIB branch to use the convbin program as a base for SBP (Swift Binary Protocol) 
  to RINEX converter (sbp2rinex).

The sbp2rinex executables for Windows, OSX and Linux are available here:
  http://downloads.swiftnav.com/tools/rinex_converter/

None of the Swift Navigation products use RTKLIB or it's derivatives for a real-time navigation.

RTKLIB post-processing results will likely differ from Swift Navigation receiver real-time output. Swift Navigation does not 
  provide support for the RTKLIB post-processing.
